\title{Copy setwd and the current directory to your clipboard (Windows)}
\usage{
clipdir()
}
\description{
Copies the working directory onto your clipboard, and puts it into a
		"setwd" command.
}
\details{
This is useful if you want to open another instance of R
		and instantly navigate to the current working directory.
		
		Before R Studio's elegant directory management, this was useful when
		opening new instances of R.  It allows the user to quickly copy the same
		the same working directory as an existing instance into the new one.  
		Also, it was useful for saving the current wd in a script after manually
		navigating there.  With R Studio just use that for your project 
		management!
		
		It's still useful when testing something in a new instance.	For example, if
		you were working in "C:/Projects/MasterProject/Examp" and you wanted to
		test something in a new instance of R, you could run clipdir(), open a new
		instance of R, and paste this command from your	clipboard:
		setwd("C:/Projects/MasterProject/Examp")
		In the new instance you would be in the old directory with all your 
		local folders.  So you can run things in parallel and test/debug/develop.
}
\note{
Only works in Windows because of clipboard.
