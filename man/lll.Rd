}
\arguments{
\item{sortBy}{Which column to sort output by.  One of 'name', 'class', 
'size'. Default is "name"}

}
\description{
Nicer version of ls() with more info, and skips functions.
}
\details{
The lll function was inspired by the ll function in 'gtools', but
		is modified for different needs.  Most notibly it doesn't list functions
		so that the list is more compact, and it's easier to see what's
		taking up space in your environment.
