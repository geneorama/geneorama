\usage{
bs(S, K, r, vol, mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{Current stock price}

\item{r}{Risk free rate of return}

\item{vol}{Volatility of the stock expressed as \eqn{\sigma}{\sigma}}

\item{mat}{Time to maturity}
}
\description{
Uses black Scholes formula to calculate the value of an option.
}
\details{
You need to convert \code{r} and \code{vol} to match the time period
		\code{mat}.
}
\note{
Assumes that the option is european, there is a constant risk-free
     interest rate, the stock price follows geometric Brownian motion with
     constant drift and volatility, and the stock does not pay a dividend.
     Also assumes that there are no transaction costs and the market is
     frictionless.
