\title{Round dates to weeks}
\usage{
round_weeks(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of dates}
}
\description{
Converts a vector of dates to weeks using data.table's IDate.
}
\details{
This function uses Sunday as the first day of the week, and will round the
		vector of dates to the first day of the week.  For other units of time
		(e.g. month, year) \code{data.table:::round.IDate} is suggested.  Currently
		IDate's round function for 'weeks' will split any week overlapping two
		years into two week parts, which usually starts the rounded weeks in the
		second year on a new day.  This function is a workaround for that behavior.
}
\note{
More details about week rounding issue (mentioned in details) here:
		\url{https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/747}

		Depends on \code{\link[data.table]{data.table}}
}
\examples{
		require(data.table)
		require(geneorama)

 	## Create a sequence of dates (or IDates)
		dd <- seq(as.IDate("2013-12-22"), as.IDate("2014-01-18"), 1)
		## Weeks rounded using default data.table method:
		round(dd, 'weeks')
		## Weeks rounded using "round_weeks":
		round_weeks(dd)
		## Rounding methods shown side-by-side
		data.table(date_original = dd,
				   weeks_dt = round(dd, 'weeks'),
				   weeks_new = round_weeks(dd),
				   wday = wday(dd),
				   weekday = weekdays(dd))
